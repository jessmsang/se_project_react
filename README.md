# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the Project

The idea of this application is pretty simple! We make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

## Technologies and Techniques Used

This project was our first project to use React. It was a good opportunity to become more fluent in state management.
